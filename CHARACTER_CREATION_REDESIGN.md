# Character Creation System Restructure

## Overview
The character creation system has been completely restructured from a single-page interface to a linear, step-by-step process. This provides a much more organized and user-friendly experience for players creating their characters.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Step-Based Structure
The character creation process now follows these distinct steps:

1. **🧬 Choose Species** - Select from available playable species (currently Terran)
2. **🏛️ Choose Background** - Pick character background (6 options available)  
3. **⚔️ Choose Faction** - Select starting faction allegiance (30+ factions)
4. **🎯 Choose Class** - Pick character class (11 classes available)
5. **🔬 Select Research Paths** - Choose up to 3 research interests (10 categories)
6. **🎲 Roll Stats** - Generate character attributes
7. **📝 Enter Name** - Set character name
8. **✅ Confirm Character** - Review and create final character

### 2. Enhanced Game Integration

#### Updated Game Class (`game.py`)
- Added new character fields: `character_faction`, `character_research_paths`, `character_created`
- Enhanced `initialize_new_game()` to handle the expanded character data structure
- Added `apply_species_bonuses()` method for species-specific starting bonuses
- Improved faction integration with starting reputation bonuses

#### Updated Character Data Structure
```python
character_data = {
    'name': 'Player Name',
    'species': 'Terran',
    'background': 'Core Worlds Noble', 
    'faction': 'The Veritas Covenant',
    'character_class': 'Merchant Captain',
    'research_paths': ['Quantum and Transdimensional', 'Etheric and Cosmic'],
    'stats': {stat_name: value, ...}
}
```

### 3. Interactive Interface (`textual_interface.py`)

#### New CharacterCreationCoordinator Class
- Manages the step-by-step process with progress tracking
- Provides interactive buttons for each selection type
- Handles validation before proceeding to next steps
- Supports navigation (back/forward) between steps

#### Key Features
- **Progress Bar**: Shows current step and completion status
- **Interactive Selections**: Buttons for species, background, faction, class choices
- **Research Path Toggle**: Select up to 3 research interests with visual feedback
- **Stats Generation**: Interactive buttons for generating and rerolling stats
- **Navigation**: Back/Next buttons with smart labeling
- **Validation**: Prevents advancement without required selections

### 4. Species Integration
- Leverages existing `species.py` with `get_playable_species()` function
- Currently supports Terran species with expansion capability
- Applies species-specific starting bonuses (credits, reputation, etc.)

### 5. Faction Integration  
- Integrates with existing `factions.py` system (30+ factions available)
- Sets starting faction allegiance with reputation bonus
- Shows faction descriptions and focuses during selection

### 6. Research Path Integration
- Connects with existing `research.py` categories system
- Allows selection of starting research interests
- Visual feedback for selection limits (3 maximum)

## Benefits

### For Players
1. **Clear Structure**: Each step is focused and unambiguous
2. **Progress Tracking**: Always know where you are in the process
3. **Easy Navigation**: Go back to change earlier decisions
4. **Better Organization**: No overwhelming single-page interface
5. **Informed Choices**: See descriptions and details for each option

### For Developers  
1. **Modular Design**: Each step is self-contained and maintainable
2. **Validation**: Built-in checks prevent incomplete characters
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new steps or modify existing ones
4. **Data Consistency**: Standardized character data structure
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation in demo mode

## Testing

### Test Results
```
✅ All imports successful
✅ Found 1 playable species: ['Terran']
✅ Found 30 factions
✅ Found 10 research categories  
✅ Found 11 character classes
✅ Found 6 character backgrounds
✅ Game initialization successful
🎉 All tests passed! Character creation system ready.
```

### Demo Output
The system successfully creates characters with:
- Species bonuses applied (+1,000 credits for Terran)
- Faction allegiance established  
- Research paths recorded
- Complete character stats generated
- Full integration with game systems

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **More Playable Species**: Add additional species beyond Terran
2. **Custom Portraits**: Character appearance customization
3. **Starting Equipment**: Choose initial gear and ships
4. **Trait Selection**: Additional character traits and quirks
5. **Background Stories**: Procedural or selected character histories
6. **Advanced Validation**: Cross-step validation and suggestions
7. **Save/Load**: Save partially created characters
8. **Randomization**: "Quick Start" with random but valid choices

### Technical Improvements
1. **Animation**: Smooth transitions between steps
2. **Tooltips**: Hover information for options
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
4. **Accessibility**: Screen reader and accessibility features
5. **Theming**: Visual customization options

## Usage

The new system is automatically used when players select "Create Character" from the main menu. The old single-page system has been replaced entirely, though the legacy `CharacterCreationScreen` class remains for compatibility and now redirects to the new system.

Players can navigate freely between steps, make changes, and only commit the character when they reach the final confirmation step. All selections are validated before proceeding, ensuring complete and valid characters are created.
